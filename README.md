**Description of my development environment for Rust**  
***version: 1.0  date: 2022-03-28 author: [dev_Bestia](https://bestia.dev) repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/LucianoBestia/development_environment)***  

## Rust

This days I mostly program with Rust on Linux.  
My primary desktop is Win10. Inside it I have WSL2, which is a Linux Virtual Machine. There I installed Debian 11 Bullseye.  
I made a detailed description in <https://github.com/LucianoBestia/win10_wsl2_debian11>.

For Rust development for Linux I have the container `rust_dev` from the image `rust_dev_vscode_img` that I described here <https://github.com/LucianoBestia/docker_rust_development>.  
This container is ephemeral and can be destroyed any time. The important files inside it must be pushed to Github or copied somewhere.
